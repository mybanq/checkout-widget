# Overview

Our Checkout widget enables platforms to quickly process payments from cards, ACH, and banq user's balance by loading a javascript widget which contains the end to end payment flow.
The payment processed by the checkout widget is configured from a backend API call and funds are settled into the merchant's banq business account.
##Types of Payments
The Open API supports a flexible set payments including:

- One time real-time payments
- Recurring payments
- Scheduled payments

##Payment Sources
End users can make payments from their:

- banq balance
- checking account
- debit & credit cards (depending on the merchants industry)
